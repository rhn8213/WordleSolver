# WordleSolver
## A basic wordle solver aimed at getting the solution within the 6 given tries.
###### The solver uses a text file of known guesses to generate guesses based on the most common letters remaining from the guesses.
###### When there is 5 or less remaining possible solutions, the user must decide which is the most likely word.
###### TODO: Get results from Wordles to see if it can solve consistently
